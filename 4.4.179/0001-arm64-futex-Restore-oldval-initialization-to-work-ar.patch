Subject: [PATCH] arm64: futex: Restore oldval initialization to work around
 buggy compilers

commit ff8acf929014b7f87315588e0daf8597c8aa9d1c upstream.

Commit 045afc24124d ("arm64: futex: Fix FUTEX_WAKE_OP atomic ops with
non-zero result value") removed oldval's zero initialization in
arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser because it is not necessary. Unfortunately,
Android's arm64 GCC 4.9.4 [1] does not agree:

../kernel/futex.c: In function 'do_futex':
../kernel/futex.c:1658:17: warning: 'oldval' may be used uninitialized
in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
   return oldval == cmparg;
                 ^
In file included from ../kernel/futex.c:73:0:
../arch/arm64/include/asm/futex.h:53:6: note: 'oldval' was declared here
  int oldval, ret, tmp;
      ^

GCC fails to follow that when ret is non-zero, futex_atomic_op_inuser
returns right away, avoiding the uninitialized use that it claims.
Restoring the zero initialization works around this issue.
